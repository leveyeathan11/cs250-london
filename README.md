User needs commonly come from those without technical knowledge, and usually sound like statements such as "I want to be able to see pictures of cats." A User Story takes these statements and translates them into goals for the development team, and the aforementioned example might become "As an end user, I want to see a new cat whenever I click 'next'." Then, it is easy to proceed to designing storage for cat photos, a 'next button,' and other program features. A good member of a software development team is often a good listener, as they will need to make these translations to deliver the product. Agile is a methodology which proritizes listening to the customer in this fashion, and thus, can be very productive in many projects, especially where there is a high degree of uncertainty. I intend to bring the Agile ideas of strong communication, openness, and transparency into my mindset no matter where my career takes me.
